## About

scrollana is a unique mobile application designed to help you become more mindful of your scrolling habits on social media and other apps. Instead of completely blocking your access to your favorite applications, SageTech takes a more gradual approach to help you develop healthier digital habits.

## Key Features

### üîç Scroll Tracking
- Monitors how much you scroll in real-time
- Converts scroll distance into relatable real-world measurements (e.g., "You've scrolled 2 humans tall" or "32 bananas long")
- Persists scroll data between sessions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Progressive Intervention
- As you scroll more, overlay warnings become increasingly visible and intrusive
- Humorous yet pointed messages encourage you to be mindful of your scrolling
- Designed to interrupt the "doom scrolling" cycle without preventing necessary app use

### üë• Social Accountability(to be build)
- Connect with friends to compare scrolling habits
- Leaderboard showcases friends who scroll the least
- Friendly competition to encourage healthier digital behavior

## Why scrollana is Different

Unlike time-based app blockers or complete lockouts, SageTech allows you to:
- Still use apps when you genuinely need them (reply to messages, check important updates)
- Experience a gradually increasing "friction" that correlates directly with your scrolling behavior
- Develop awareness of your habits through real-time feedback
- Build better digital habits through gentle nudges rather than absolute restrictions

## How It Works

1. scrollana runs in the background while you use other apps
2. As you scroll, it tracks the distance and displays creative comparisons
3. The overlay becomes more prominent the more you scroll
4. Connect with friends to see who can maintain the healthiest scrolling habits
5. Reset daily to give you a fresh start

## Getting Started

Download from our published apk on github also give it all the permissions it needs 

## Privacy

SageTech values your privacy:
- Your scrolling data is stored locally on your device
- Only anonymized, aggregate data is shared with friends when you explicitly enable the social features
- We never track the content you view, only the physical scrolling distance
